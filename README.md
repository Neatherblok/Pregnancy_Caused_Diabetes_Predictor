# Pregnancy Caused Diabetes Predictor

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a model to identify pregnant women who have a greater likelihood of developing gestational diabetes. By doing so, the hospital can provide better clinical services to patients, improve patient outcomes, and reduce the cost of care. The dataset used for this project is `patients.csv`, which contains several independent variables and a dependent variable labeled as `Diagnosis`. All patients in the dataset are women of at least 21 years of age.
